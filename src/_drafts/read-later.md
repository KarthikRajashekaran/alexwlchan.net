title: Staying on top of "Read Later"
---

For a long time, I've been saving links with Read Later services like Instapaper, Pocket, and Readability.
All sorts of things that looked interesting, that I thought I'd like to read someday.
Even if I couldn't read something immediately, I'd read it *eventually*.
That was the theory, anyway.

In practice, I ended up building a backlog.
The time to read this collection of supposedly interesting links never came, and I have an ever-growing queue of things to read.
The backlog became a source of stress.
I was just spamming my future self.

Every few months, I'd throw up my hands, delete everything, and start over.
And every time, I had good intentions.
*This time*, I told myself, *this time I'd read the links I'd saved*.
Over and over.

It will always be faster and easier to save something than to read it.
In a minute of scrolling Twitter, I can save links that add up to hours of reading.
But if I don't have enough time to read it now, why do I think I'll have that time later?

Last year, I was clearing my queues for the umpteenth time, and I wanted to try something different.
Good intentions weren't enough -- I needed a different process.

So my new rule is this: **I read something today, or not at all**.

I save links throughout the day, and at the end of each day, I review my inbox.
I read some of it -- on good days, most of it.
If I don't have time to look at it then, but I really want to keep it -- say, a conference talk I want to watch, or research material -- I save it to Things.app or Notes.app as appropriate.
*Reading* something important is the same as *doing* something important, and I can prioritise it accordingly.
In practice, that's a small fraction of what I originally saved.
Everything else gets deleted.
But it doesn't just sit around on a growing queue.

I still waste time on the Internet.
Different reading list habits won't change that!
But I'm less stressed about the things I'll supposedly read later.
I've stopped my queue from ever growing -- and if you have the same bad habits I used to have, I'd recommend you try it to.
